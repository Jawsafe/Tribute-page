            <p>English mathematician, logician, and computer scientist Alan Mathison Turing was born on June 23, 1912, and passed away on June 7, 1954. The development of theoretical computer science was greatly aided by his formalization of the concepts of algorithms and computing using the Turing machine.</p>
            <p>Turing is widely recognized as the father of computer science and artificial intelligence. Through his deciphering of the German Enigma code, he played a crucial role in the Allies' triumph in World War II.
            </p>
            <p>After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine, one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he helped develop the Manchester computers and became interested in mathematical biology.</p>
            <p>Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts. He accepted hormone treatment with DES, a procedure commonly referred to as chemical castration, as an alternative to prison. Turing died on 7 June 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from cyanide poisoning.</p>
